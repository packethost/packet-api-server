# Packet API Server

This repository contains a library and command-line of a subset of the Packet API Server. At this point, it is **not** intended to be
a full-fledged replacement server. Its primary purpose is a reusable server to test various clients that speak to the Packet API.

Eventually, it may become a full-fledged server.
